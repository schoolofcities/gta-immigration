It's part of the trend we're seeing across North America where <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a7607626-5491-48bd-aa56-5a10cbeeb768" target="_blank">immigrants</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-so-many-second-generation-south-asian-and-chinese-canadians-planning-to-vote-conservative-253820" target="_blank">minorities</a> are swinging to the political right; and it's also a story of how one of the GTA's largest constituencies is much more dynamic than we often realize.</p></div> <div class="plots-title svelte-1el3qlx"><h4>Ridings with more immigrants are increasingly voting Conservative</h4> <p class="svelte-1el3qlx">Correlation between immigrants (as % of population) and voting Conservative in Ontario provincial elections</p></div> <div class="plots-container svelte-1el3qlx"><!--[--><!--]--></div><!----> <div class="text"><p>Since the late twentieth century, researchers have noted the changing demographics in Canada's suburbs, particularly in terms of ethnicity and immigrant status.<span class="footnote-ref-wrapper svelte-1di2uw2"><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" class="footnote-ref svelte-1di2uw2">1</a></span><!----> In the Greater Toronto Area, the share of immigrants in the inner suburbs (Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough) has grown since the 1970s, and in the outer suburbs (Halton, Peel, York, and Durham) since the 1990s, while declining in the inner city region (City of Toronto) at the same time.<span class="footnote-ref-wrapper svelte-1di2uw2"><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" class="footnote-ref svelte-1di2uw2">2</a></span><!----> Additionally, since <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/rp02_8-dr02_8/p3.html" target="_blank">immigration reform in 1967</a> – which abolished race and nationality quotas in favour of a point-based system – immigrants have increasingly been visible minorities.<span class="footnote-ref-wrapper svelte-1di2uw2"><a id="footnote-ref-3" href="#footnote-3" class="footnote-ref svelte-1di2uw2">3</a></span><!----></p> <p>How has this changing composition played out in the political and electoral landscape of the GTA?</p></div> <div class="text"><h2>Does party vote share correspond to where immigrants live?</h2> <p>In 2018, the provincial Conservatives pulled off a historic feat: immigrant-heavy ridings were more likely than not to vote for them. Neither the provincial nor federal Conservatives had pulled this off in the time we reviewed in this study – looking at census data since 1961 – and certainly not since the official end of race-based immigration quotas in 1967.</p></div> <div class="container"><div style="margin-bottom: -20px; margin-top: -25px;"><div class="sentence-controls"><p>The plot below traces the correlation between party vote share and percentage of immigrants in each riding, for all <select class="inline-select"><option value="federal">federal</option><option value="ontario" selected>Ontario</option></select> elections.

While the federal Liberals had always performed well in immigrant-heavy ridings, their popularity rose steeply from the 1972 election onwards, to reach all-time highs for four decades before starting to fall in the 2010s.</p> <p>While the Liberals still reigned supreme federally, the federal Conservatives became much more competitive in immigrant-heavy ridings beginning in the early 2000s. This may coincide with federal Conservative leader and Prime Minister Stephen Harper's <a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2006/05/primeminister-stephen-harper-reaching-canadian-immigrants-0597.html#gs.l52rih" target="_blank">immigrant-friendly policies</a>.</p> <p>More recently, in a study funded by the School of Cities<span class="footnote-ref-wrapper svelte-1di2uw2"><a id="footnote-ref-5" href="#footnote-5" class="footnote-ref svelte-1di2uw2">5</a></span><!---->, Professor Emine Fidan Elcioglu found many second generation immigrants had started voting Conservative as a way of assimilating – following years of outreach by the federal Conservatives into suburban and minority communities.</p> <p>The left-leaning New Democrats have, in contrast, seen a steep fall in popularity since 2004. The party has yet to recover and continues to decline in immigrant-heavy ridings.</p> <h4>Provincial</h4> <p>While Conservatives at both levels have seen rising support in recent decades in the ridings where immigrants live, there's one major difference: since 2018, Ontario's Conservatives have become the party of immigrants in the GTA. Unlike their federal counterpart, who has made gains but is still outcompeted by the Liberals, they have ranked or tied for first place in immigrant-heavy ridings in each election since.</p> <p>This is a remarkable shift from decades past, when more immigrants meant fewer votes for the Conservatives – reaching an all-time low as recently as 1995.</p> <p>Equally unlike the federal level, it was Ontario's New Democrats who were most popular in immigrant-heavy ridings throughout the 1970s and 80s, largely during the leaderships of Stephen Lewis and Bob Rae. They would be overshadowed by the provincial Liberals in 1987 (who, in turn, would dominate until 2018), but remained competitive in immigrant-heavy ridings until the early 2000s. Since then, they've seen a decline similar to their federal counterpart.</p> <p>Nonetheless, all the trends we see are in the big picture, and there are exceptions. The plots below show the fine details of the relationship between percent immigrants and party vote share for individual GTA ridings in each election: points further to the right indicate a higher percentage of immigrants in the riding, and points higher on the plot indicate a larger party vote share.</p></div> <div class="container"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: -25px;"><div class="sentence-controls"><p>View the correlation between percent immigrants and party vote share for the <select class="inline-select"><!--[--><!--]--></select> in the <select class="inline-select"><!--[--><option value="1963">1963</option><option value="1967">1967</option><option value="1971">1971</option><option value="1975">1975</option><option value="1977">1977</option><option value="1981">1981</option><option value="1985">1985</option><option value="1987">1987</option><option value="1990">1990</option><option value="1995">1995</option><option value="1999">1999</option><option value="2003">2003</option><option value="2007">2007</option><option value="2011">2011</option><option value="2014">2014</option><option value="2018">2018</option><option value="2022">2022</option><option value="2025" selected>2025</option><!--]--></select> <select class="inline-select"><option value="federal">federal</option><option value="ontario" selected>Ontario</option></select> election.</p></div> <div id="scatter-display" class="svelte-12ft76x"></div> <div><div class="info-row" style="border-top: solid 1px #f0f0f0;"><!--[!--><p><i>Hover/click on a point</i></p><!--]--></div> <div class="info-row"><!--[!--><p>Vote share = <b>N/A</b></p><!--]--></div> <div class="info-row"><!--[!--><p>Percent immigrants = <b>N/A</b></p><!--]--></div></div></div><!----></div> <div class="text"><h2>How do different ridings compare geographically?</h2> <p>Toronto's suburbs have become the heart of immigration in the region - in Scarborough since the 1980s, and then later in Brampton, Markham, and Mississauga.

This shift suggests the development of suburban immigrant strongholds – perhaps a result of the Liberals’ welcoming immigration policies since the 1970s.</p> <p>In contrast, the heyday of the provincial New Democrats in the 1970s and 80s was quite geographically contained. They were popular in immigrant-heavy ridings along the western edge of inner-city Toronto – around the Humber River, from Parkdale to Davenport to Black Creek – where they succeeded with certain kinds of immigrants. But they failed to make inroads into more typically non-white suburban immigrant communities. Save fleeting success in Brampton in the 2010s, they've had little luck.</p> <p>And it's in these suburban, non-white, and immigrant-heavy ridings that the provincial Conservatives have seen their greatest successes. Some of the biggest gains in 2018 were in Markham and North Scarborough, which they've maintained since. These ridings are home to mostly East Asian visible minorities, who the provincial Conservatives made a <a href="https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/organizing-the-suburbs" target="_blank">concerted effort to</a> access through ethnic churches, media, and socially conservative issues</p><p>Moreover, while they failed to sweep Brampton and North Mississauga in 2018, both elections since – in 2022 and 2025 – saw the Conservatives flip these ridings and continue to grow their margins. This suggests growing inroads with South Asian visible minorities, who dominate the region.</p></div> <div class="text"><h2>Do parties over-perform in the most immigrant-heavy ridings?</h2> <p>Correlation and geography shed a lot of light on what is happening, and where. How much better or worse do parties perform in the most immigrant-heavy ridings, compared to elsewhere? Basically, when most people in a riding are immigrants, do we see the same trends and political preferences?</p></div> <div class="container"><div style="margin-bottom: -20px; margin-top: -25px;"><div class="sentence-controls"><p>Show how the major parties perform in the top 5 most immigrant ridings over time for <select class="inline-select"><option value="federal">federal</option><option value="ontario" selected>Ontario</option></select> elections, compared to their performance in the <select class="inline-select"><option value="gta">GTA</option><option value="full" selected>full</option></select> election.</p></div> <svg id="vote-share-graph" height="400" class="svelte-1c1gea3"></svg></div><!----></div> <div class="text"><p>More or less, the answer is yes – we see the same broad trends. The federal Liberals still have the greatest leads, the provincial New Democrats still made inroads in the 1970s and 1980s before declining in recent years, and the rise of the Conservatives in the last decade - especially at the provincial level - is without dispute.</p> <p>But it's between the cracks of these big conclusions that we get the nuances of what is happening, when, and how much. Even by 2014, ahead of their breakthrough, provincial Conservatives had begun doing better in immigrant-heavy ridings compared to the rest of the GTA, indicating that a foundation had already been laid.</p> <p>Likewise, the federal Liberals not only continue to win over immigrants but in the most immigrant-heavy ridings, have consistently done better than their national vote share by 20% or 30% – showing just how deep immigrant loyalties lie – while the New Democrats’ decline may trace back as far as the 1980s.</p> <p>It also tells us what we don't know. We've looked at immigrants as a whole, but not at how different kinds of immigrants – varying by ethnicity, class, geography, and so on – participate (or do not or cannot participate electorally, either through turnout or voting restrictions).</p> <p>At about half of the population of the region, and a quarter of the country, immigrants are a major political constituency and a key part of the path to power for political parties. They form and lose loyalties to different parties at different times, and while these changes may feel like sudden shocks in the moment, by taking a step back we see competing long-term trends and political battles playing out over many years – just like any other group, immigrants are not a monolith.</p></div> <div class="text"><br> <br> <div class="footnotes"><h3>Data &amp; Methods</h3> <p>We obtained federal election results from <a href="https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/Canadian-Federal-Elections/tree/main" target="_blank">Lucas Czarnecki's database</a>, sourced from Canada's Library of Parliament (LoP), and Ontario election results from <a href="https://www.elections.on.ca/en/resource-centre/elections-results.html" target="_blank">Elections Ontario</a>.</p> <p>For consistency, we focused on the three major parties in Anglo-Canada – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" target="_blank">Liberals</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party" target="_blank">New Democrats</a>, and Conservatives – while grouping all other parties under "Other".
