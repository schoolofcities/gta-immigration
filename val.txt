This is good. There is another case. The text and CSV I provided to you is only applicable to csvs that are for federal elections. I also want to produce the same output for csvs that are for Ontario elections whose input CSV will look slightly different. You can tell that it is Ontario election CSV because it will have a column with the value "Plurality".

I've attached an Ontario CSV for example, and I believe you can largely preserve much of the code, with a few changes. First, a couple columns need to be renamed to align them with the federal case for preprocessing:

 - `Electoral District` --> `Constituency`

 - `Party` --> `Political_Affiliation`

 - `Votes Cast` --> `Votes`

In the newly renamed `Constituency` column, you can remove all additional numbers, hyphens, and spaces, at the start. Usually the constituency is of the format '000 - NAME' where we just want NAME.

Next, we need to include a few more labels for the party mappings. These include,

 - 'PC', 'PCP'

 - 'ND', 'NDP'

 - 'L', 'OLP', 'LIB'
